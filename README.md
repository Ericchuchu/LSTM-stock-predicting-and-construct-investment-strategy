# LSTM-stock-predicting-and-construct-investment-strategy
This project employs four different deep learning architectures (LSTM, Conv-LSTM, GRU, GRU2) to predict stock prices and develop investment trading strategies. Currently, it utilizes Taiwan stocks for backtesting. The selection of individual stocks is primarily based on the proportion of institutional holdings and trading volume, although this criterion may be refined and modified in the future. At present, these models are still in their initial stages, but the trading performance of individual stocks generally shows an annualized return rate of 50-100%, with a Sharpe ratio consistently above 2.5. Detailed backtesting results can be viewed in the HTML file within the trade folder. Finally, the project aims to optimize trading decisions by identifying parameter plateaus through multiple trials.
